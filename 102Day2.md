>Important features in a code editor: code completion, syntax highlighting, a variety of themes to reduce eye strain, and a healthy amount of extensions, and a great feature is code completion.

>Another feature you should definitely look into is called syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text

>While you certainly can use Notepad and Text Edit to make websites, there are other text editors available that might help you code more efficiently.

>Also, make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on your computer, that you first create a folder on your computer somewhere (maybe on your Desktop, for example) to store your entire website. As you create new documents with the text editor that comes on your computer, save those files in the appropriate folders or sub-folders within the main website folder.

>Also, please make sure that when you’re saving your file, that they have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names. For example, your main HTML file should be called, “index.html.” Your CSS file should be called something like “style.css.” The filename isn’t as important as the extension (the “.html” and the “.css”).




**Local Version Control systems. A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.**

>need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)

 >Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it

>Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

>Git includes inherent Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools

**Getting Help
There are three ways to get more information on a particular command, by accessing the manual:**
**git help command**

**git command --help**

**man git-command**


>The local Git repository has three components:
>Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
>Index: The area used for staging
>Head: Points to the most recent commit

>all files in a checked out (or working) copy of a project file are either in a tracked or untracked state.
**Tracked**
>Tracked files can be modified, unmodified, or staged; they were part of the most recent file snapshot.
**Untracked**
>Untracked files were not in the last snapshot and do not currently reside in the staging area.

>To push your changes “upstream” for sharing, you would use the following git push command format:
>git push [remote-name][branch-name]
**Example:**
>$ git push origin master
>*This command pushes committed changes from your local “master” branch upstream to the “origin” server.

# Reading Programming with Java

## How javascript makes pages interactive

> Access Contents
> MOdify Content
> Programrules
> React to events

## Examples of JavaScript in the Browser

> slideshows
> forms
> reload part of page
> filtering data

quick refresher of HTML and CSS on page 9

## Expressions and Operators

>Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
> Use two or more values to return a single value

## Operators
 >see page 75
 >Arithmetic Operators are containd in JS which you can use with numbers, like in math class
 > See page 76
 page 77 is cool!

 A string Operator +
 > it is used to join strings on either side of it
 pg 78, notes on quotes and NaN

 ## The welcome code is on page 79
 It adds extra flair!

 ## What is a function?

 Functions let you groug a series of statements together to preform a specific task

 FUNCTIONREVIEW
-----|-----------
calling the funtion|When you ask it to preform its task
Parameters|pieces of information passed to a function
Return Value|you write a function and expect it to return a value

> see page 91-94 for examples


# Reading 08

## CVomparison and logical operators: 150-151

> Flow cahrts help plan decision making
> There are two components to decision making: an expression is evaluated, which returns a value, and a conditional statement says what to do in a given sityuation

## 156 and 157

> logical operators
> comparison operators usually return a single value of true or false, but logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator

## For and While loops

> ##### loops
> these check a condition
> for loop... most common, the condition is usually a counter to tell how many times a loop should run

##### Loop counters

>intructs the code to run a certain number of times
>Initialization: create a varible and set it to zero. commonly called i and acts as the counter
> Condition: the loops should contine to run until it reaches a specified number
> Update: everytime the loop run the statement in curly braces, it adds one to the counter

##### Using while loops

> each time a loop is run another calculation is written into the variable called msg
> As long as the condition in the parenthesis is true, this loops will continue to run
> += operator adds new content to the msg operator
> += works as shorthand for msg=msg+ 'new msg'
> inside the loop the second statement increments the counter by one

>Loops continues to run as long as the condition is met

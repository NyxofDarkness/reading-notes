## Ducket HTML

##### Chapter 3

**3 Types of HTML Lists**
1. ordered-numbers
2. unordered-bullets
3. definition-define terminology

* these can be nested!

##### Chapter 13

* CSS controls each element of HTML by seeing them as boxes. Boxes within boxes!
* if it has a tag, CSS has it in a box! like addresses to the post office!
* you can hide elements using display and visability properties
block-level and inline-level boxes can be made into eachother if you need
CSS#- Rounded boarders and image borders! yay!

## Ducket JS

##### Review chapter 2

**ARRAYS**
> An Array is a special type of variable that stores a list of values
* you don't need to know how many list items it contains
good for things like shopping lists, because it is a list of related items

> You create an array just like any other vaiable, using var and giving it a name 

* the prefered method of creating an array is the array literal
* There are also array constructors. 
> Values in arrays are accessed like they are a numbered list

**THE NUMBER OF THIS LIST STARTS AT ZERO(NOT ONE)**
page 73 needs more thinking. you can access and change the values in an array

##### Chapter 4

1. if...else staements. if true the first code is executed, if false the second is
2. Switch statements... you get a default if nothing matches... cool!
3. if a match is found that code is ran and the break statement stops the rest from running, where as with an if...else statement the whole code is still ran, slowing it down
4. the break; keyword is after each switch statement, very important because it stops the code there, breaking it out of the cycle into the next code!
5. Loops see page 170 for an example, 
6. loops check a condition 
* for-loop:you need the code to run a specific number of times
* while-loop: you don't know how many times a code should run
* do while-loop: very simular to the while-loop, but always runs the statements inside the curly brackets at least once.

7. loop counters, for-loop uses this as a condition to instruct the code to run a specific number of times
*. page 172-173 visual examples
8. data types can be sent from one type to another
9. all values evaluate to either truthy or falsey

##### Chapter 4, Links

* Links allow you to move from one web page to another

* Writing links: 
1. opening link tag in <> (this is the link to the new page)
2. put in <> a herf=and the web link in quotes
3. then the text the user clicks on
closing tag for a!

> remember to start with li tag!

> if youre linking to a page on your own site its best to use realative links rather than qualified URLS

> you can create links to open email addresses in the too feild

> you can use the id attribute to link elements within a page

##### Chapter 15, Layout

> Controlling POsition of elements

1. position elements using normal flow, relative position, absolute position and floats
* normal flow
* realative positioning
* absolute positioning
* nfixed positioning
* floating elements
examples on 363-364!

> use floats to create multi-colum layouts

2. how device resolutions effect experience
* resolution is the number of dots per square inch
* desgners try to create pages between 960-1000 px wide because screens vary so much

3. difference between fixed width and liquid layouts
* fixed does not change size as users increase or decrease the size of their windows
these tend to be given in px!
* liquid designs stretch and contract with the users change of screen size
these tend to use percentages
4. how designers use grids to make their page look for professional
* This is the grid structure to help position things on a page
* 960 pixel grid is mostr commonly used
* examples page 389-390
> example layouts of code pages 390-402
> creating site layouts

useful for Designing for different size screens


## Ducket JS 

##### Chapter 3, functions, methods, and objects
*Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize thier code.*
* *calling the function* when you ask your function to preform a task
* *parameters* peices of information passed to a function
* *return value* the answer the funtion gives you
* see page90-95 for examples!

*function declaration* creates a funsction you can call later in your code
*named functions* you need a name to call the functions later in the code
*function expression* if you put a function where an expression is expected and its treated as an expression
*anoymous function* in function expressions where a name is omitted
*scope* location where you declare a variable can only be sued in that function

##### Article: 6 reasons for pair programming

* pair programming usually involves two roles, the driver and the navigator

Driver is the one who dowes all the typing, coding, and only hands on the keyboard

The navigator uses their words to guide the driver but does not provide any direct imput into the computer

* the navigator thinks of the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithum may be converted into code, ect

> pair programming touches on four skills
1. developers explain outloud what code shoudl do
2. listen to others guidance
3. read code that others have written
4. write code themselves

> Reasons why
1. More efficient- easier to catch mistakes saving time!
2. engaged collaboration-harder to put off the work
3. learn from fellow coders- exposes you to other techniques, new things, and better styles
4. job interview readiness-common practice is to pair program with a current employee
5. work envirment readiness-less hurdles when you have had practice!

##### Chapter 4, Links

**We already know that links connect pages on the web to each other, but did you know that we can write them too?**

*Writing links:* 
1. *opening link tag in <> (this is the link to the new page)*
2. *put in <> a herf=and the web link in quotes*
3. *then the text the user clicks on*
4. *closing tag \</a>*

> remember to start with li tag!

> if you're linking to a page on your own site its best to use relative (or ones on your own computer) links rather than qualified URLS

> you can create links to open email addresses in the too field

> you can use the id attribute to link elements within a page

> There are some fine examples of links here!

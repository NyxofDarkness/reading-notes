# Readings: DSA Review

## Whiteboard Advice

> communicate, communicate, communicate!

> Do you understand what they’re asking you to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation

> Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them. 

> Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.

> you can ask if your pseudocode makes sense to the interviewer.

> Not illegal: “I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?”

> Are you curious whether there will be a coding portion of the interview? Ask them! 

## 6 Tips

> Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.

> “Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking.”

> You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable

> BEST WAY OUT WHEN YOU CAN'T REMEMBER:

> “…and here, I’d use whatever the list.contains() equivalent is in JavaScript. I know it’s not contains, but I can’t remember the method name right now, so we’ll call it contains() for now and I’d look it up right now if I were coding this.”

## Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed

> Focus more on HOW we solve the problem, not so much on the memorization of information

> Don't worry about knowing the questions, but focus on HOW you solve the problems

> not about memorizing techniques

> preperation is useful

> spend a couple weeks, preparing, know your basic DSA really way

> binary search tree was mentioned

> be comfy with the basics

> push yourself on harder problems

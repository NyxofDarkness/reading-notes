# Readings: Linear Regressions

## How to Run Linear Regression in Python

NOTE: Since this demo was published scikit-learn has been updated. The train_test_split function is now imported from sklearn.model_selection

> Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.

> sklearn.linear_model = methods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variables

> I think i'm starting to understand the usefullness of dataframes. I don't want an entire list of things, but a well thought out, and well organized work, with only the relevant information

> How to make a plot:

``` python
plt.scatter(first_variable_x_axis, second_lable_y_axis)
plt.xlabel("name for x axis")
plt.ylabel("name for y label")
plt.title("titlename")
plt.show()  <--shows plot dots>
```

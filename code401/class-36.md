# Reading: Open Source Contributions

> On one hand it's super weird looking through other people's written code. It feels a little like going through drawers in their home, you get that feeling?

> On the other hand, it is so satisfying to be able to collaborate with people from all over the web. 

> Github has special tags that allow you to set or see issues that are good for newbies. You can search github for this. 

> If you are an OSS project owner, then consider marking a few open issues with the label first-timers-only.

> The first-timers-only label explicitly announces:

I’m willing to hold your hand so you can make your first PR. This issue is a bit easier than normal. And anyone who’s already contributed to open source isn’t allowed to touch this one!

## Getting started with Django

Django is cool! In the example app, you can have:

1. A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
2. An administrative interface that lets you add, change and delete polls.

Here is the [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/)

It's an object-relational mapper! 

> Deﬁne your data models entirely in Python. You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free — but you can still write SQL if needed

> Like a table of contents for your app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views

> flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed.

>  form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types. Django also provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data.

>  full-featured and secure authentication system

> automatic admin interface

>  full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones.

## How Django Works Behind the Scenes

>  originally developed at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper by Adrian Holovaty, Simon Willison, and Jacob Kaplan-Moss. The code was open-sourced in 2005 and developers immediately started making contributions to the codebase

> Types of funding for open-source projects: Corporate Sponsor , Solo, Non-Profit

> One of the best ways to become more involved in Django is to attend an annual conference and meet all the contributors in person

## Code of Ethics

[Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)

1. Professionals in tech fields should affirm an obligation to look after the ethics of health, safety, personal security, and priacy. 
2. We should also promote fundamental human rights, and protecting induviduals right to autonomity. 
3. We should strive to minimize or eleminate harm or potential harm to others. 
4. Take fair action. If there are two conflicting interests, take the road that helps the disadvantaged first. 
5. Resect privacy. This includes trying to help society as a whole have safe experiences with technology, meaning actually deleting data when asked. 

> Key take-aways: We should strive to know and follow rules and laws by our governing authorities, but also bring to attention and challenge those that become less ethical. Strive everyday to work in the interests of the society. Strive for good. 

[Software Engineering Code of Ethics](https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code/)

1. Work with the interests and values of the public in mind
2. Keeping that public interest in mind, tech employees should work their best, and highest quality work, while maintaining the interests of their clients and employers.
3. How you are treating you work matters. Do keep integrity, by utilizing your independence in judgments. Sometimes things will come up and be asked of you that goes against your code of ethics, and no is a fine answer. 
4. We keep the public interest in mind, because as a whole we effect the outlook and reputation of software engineering. We should hold ourselves, and peers accountable.
5. Lifelong learning. Technology is always changing, and as a profession that is highly sought after, we must maintain our knowledge base. 

> Key take-aways: Don't rest, knowing that technology moves quickly. We must refine and maintain skills to keep our work above par. Do better. Be better.

## Ethics in the workplace

[The code I’m still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/)

1. This is interesting. There are strict laws about advertising medications directly to consumers, and instead of questioning the institution that hired him, he went ahead with the project anyways.
2. I don't think the anecdotes from his personal life, and how the drug affected women was relevant. Think of it this way, Canada says no advertising, so how would setting up quizzes to direct people to certain drug advertisments not be advertisings? That is a grey area. 
3. Big red-flag is that the quiz almost always led to the drug.
4. Just because something is technically legal, doesn't mean that it is ethically sound. 
5. This line means a lot to me: We are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices

> Key take-aways:  I respect him for leaving after finding the breached ethics, even though it seemed more personally and emotionally motivated.

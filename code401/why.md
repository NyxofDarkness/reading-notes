# Your why, and the Big O Notation

## Pain and Suffering

1. This article is about the pain we experience as we are learning. We are in an excellerated course, where many people can fail if they do not notice the good things about it! We must remain focused and ready to battle.

> Whatâ€™s your perspective?

> Are you doing this for you?
yes. For my curiosity, for my need to know more, but also for my family who rely so heavily on me.

## Beginners Guide to Big O

> O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
> O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set
> O(N2) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set
> O(2N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set.
> O(log N). The iterative halving of data sets described in the binary search example produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase... remember logarithums from stats class?

## In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python

refactoring and unit tests

> Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

test-driven development is when you write the tests first!

think in baby steps... he thought what is a small test we can do against the function that will return the gender from the api?

Be sure to watch your test names

AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert.:
1. Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
2. Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);
3. Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.

> The cycle is made by three steps:

> ðŸ†˜ Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isnâ€™t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)
> âœ… Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)
> ðŸ”µ Refactor the code â€” the first version doesnâ€™t need to be the beautiful one (donâ€™t be shy)

The next step is to ask "what is needed to make this test pass?"

## Recursion

> The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly
> this phenomenon is named as recursion and the function containing recursion is called recursive function
> If the memory is exhausted by these functions on the stack, it will cause a stack overflow error
> recursive function is tail recursive when recursive call is the last thing executed by the function

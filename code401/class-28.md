Here is a quiz on graphs!

1. What is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices potentially connected by line segments?

2. What is another name for verticies?

3. What are line segments called?

4. Define Vertex?

5. Define Edge?

6. Define Degree?

7. Define neighbor?

8. What is an undirected graph?

9. What is another name for Digraph?

10. What is a Digraph?

11. Concerning a digraph, what's sp special about their nodes?

12. What are the three types of graphs?

13. What is a complete graph?

14. What is a connected graph?

15. What is a disconnected graph?

16. What is a Acyclic graph?

17. Define a cycle in reference to graphs?

18. A directed acyclic graph is also called a what?

19. A Cyclic graph is a graph that has what?

20. Define a Cyclic graph?

21. What two ways do we represent graphs?

22. An ______ ______ is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix

23. a _____ graph is when there are very few connections. a _____ graph is when there are many connections

24. What is the most common way to represent graphs?

25. An _________ list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

26. A ________ ______ is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges.

27. You can traverse a graph using _______ First traversal or _____ first traversal.

28. Traversing a graph that has cycles will result in an infinite loop….this is bad. To prevent such behavior, we need to have some way to keep track of whether a vertex has been “________” before. Upon each visit, we’ll add the previously-unvisited vertex to a _______ set, so we know not to visit it again as traversal continues.

29. In a _____ _____ traversal, we approach it a bit different than the way we do when working with a depth first traversal of a tree. 

30. Similar to how the breadth-first uses a queue, we are going to use a _____ for our depth-first traversal.

#Design Web Pages with CSS

## Chapter 10
Imagine a box around each HTML element
This CSS allows you to control how each induvidual box is presented
Gives each selctor from HTYML elements and style declaration
##CSS declarations are in curly brackets, and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value
each sepersted by a semicolon
ilclude css rules in a HTML page by nusing '<style>'
allows each page to have different style

external css uses '<link>' 
allows the integrations of all the pages of a website. 
They can look the same, and also allows for easier changes overall

So fun! I really loved this excercise, because it let me practice in a safe and pre-made enviroment! 
 
I will remember this and try to break down some other easy websites I know!

I ran into issues between git and git hub. I couldn't push changes to remote. I hope this works! I had to connect github and VS Code. 

## How Computers Work Playlist Notes

##### how computers work

information in computer represented through electrical signals on or off

##### What makes a Computer a computer

tools to help us solve problems

inventions like computers are to help us with thinking work. 

Computers needed to do 4 different tasks.
> input the information
> Store the information
> process the information
> and output the information

Thats what makes a computer a computer

computers started as basic calculators

> Imput-Stuff the world or you do that tells the computer to do stuff
> Storage and processing-takes info from memory using an algarithim and back, continuing until its ready to be output
> Output can be display, signals, anything that makes it "go!"

##### Binary and Data

>computers work on ones and zeros, but almost nobody use them anymore.

electric wires and circuts do it!

signals are either on or off!

on/off state is called a bit

binary number system

with these two digits we can count up to any number!

8 bit=8 wires each can be on or off representing 1/0's

a pixel has red blue green and can be off or on. 

##### circuts and logic

every imput and output is a type of information represented by on or off of signals, or ones and zeros!

A computer needs to modify these to understand!

To do this it used millions of teeny tiny components 

wow!

##### Memory, CPU, imput, output

Computers follow thouasnds of instructions just for simple typing! They just do it in a fast way1

##### Hardware and Software

Inside a computing device there are circuts, chips, wires, speakers, plugs, and all sorts of other stuff

This is the hardware!

What you dont see is all the software running code, 
>apps, games, webpages, ect

How do they interact?
> CPU (smaller parts and circuts to send info)
>programming languages help us write binary faster!

software tells the CPU what to do

operating program tells the computer hwo to do the things!
it lets you controlof whats on the computer

Bill Gates: 'When you learn to code, you get to define the problem you want to solve, and write the software that turns those ideas into reality.'

## Growth Minds are Flexible Minds

*Developing a growth mindset starts with dedication to failure. You must embrace the unknown, in order to study and learn from it. You must traverse across voids of thoughts, jumping across to understanding.  There will always be something new to learn, new paths to explore. A growth mindset is looking through the void and seeing possibility.*

## Growth Minds are Reminded Minds

*How often do you find yourself starting some project, only to get overwhelmed, quitting before you truly understood the work? Here is a list of things I like to do to remind myself failure and unknowns are not my Forever.*

> It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer. – Albert Einstein

> No problem can withstand the assault of sustained thinking. – Voltaire

> A challenge only becomes an obstacle when you bow to it. – Ray Davis

* Your computer contacts DNS (domain name system). These are like phone books. DNS returns to your computer with the unique number that allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you’re requesting. 
* A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users. 
* The web server then sends webpage back to your computer

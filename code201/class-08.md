**To control the positions of elements, read further!**


1. position elements using normal flow, relative position, absolute position and floats

* normal flow- every block level element appears on a new line, this is the **default** behavoir
* relative positioning-moves the element from where iut would be in a normal flow shifting it to the top, right, left, or bottom of where it is
* absolute positioning-positions the element in relation to it's containing element
* fixed positioning-positions the element to the browser instead of the containing element, its a type of relative positioning
* floating elements-takes element out of the normal flow and allows it to position to the far right or left
examples on 363-364!

> use floats to create multi-column layouts

2. how device resolutions effect experience
* resolution is the number of dots per square inch
* designers try to create pages between 960-1000 px wide because screens vary so much

3. difference between fixed width and liquid layouts
* fixed does not change size as users increase or decrease the size of their windows
these tend to be given in px!
* liquid designs stretch and contract with the users change of screen size
these tend to use percentages
4. how designers use grids to make their page look for professional
* This is the grid structure to help position things on a page
* 960 pixel grid is most commonly used
* examples page 389-390

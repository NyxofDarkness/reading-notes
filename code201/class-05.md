**Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)**

> how to add images to pages

* the <img> tag is used to add images to web pages
you must always specify a src attribute to describe the content of an image

> choosing the correct format

* Photographs saved as JPEGS
* illustrations or logos that use flat colors are best as GIFS

> optimizing images for the web

* save images at the size you will be using them on the web, and in a appropriate format

> 3 rules for images
1. save images in teh correct format
2. save images at the correct size
3. measure images in pixels

// I should get an image editor //

do some more research into vector format images (used for logos and flat color images) on page 116

> figure and figure captioning: use *<figure>* contains images and their captions so the two are related. you may have multiple images in this! use *<figcaption>* allows web page authors to give an image a caption

**Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)**

> How to specify color

There are 3 ways to specify color in CSS:
1. RGB values
2. hex codes
3. color names

Make sure the contrast between the background and the text is enough that people can read it

> Color terminology and contrast

We now have a selector RGBA to indicate opacity!

> background color

HSLA lets you specify colors as HSL values with optional opacity value,
this is great for making sure background colors dont create usability

Question: When they say the result of using opacity in older browsers will be convered to no opacity, should we be taking that into account for our code? Where do we draw the line between using this and not using this? 

**Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)**

> size and typeface of font
Types of fonts
1. serif
2. sans-serif
3. monospace

> bold, italics, capitals, underlines
> font-weight adds emphasis and effect whitespace on page
> italic fonts have cursive aspects, oblique puts the words at an angle
> stretch refers to how thin, wide, or close the letters are to eachother

**see choosing a typeface on page 269** 

There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people have installed

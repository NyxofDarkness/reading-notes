## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Greater efficiency
code may take longer, but make shigher quality code that saves later efforts. WHen one is stuck, communication between the pair help solve the problems creating efficiency!
2. Engaged collaboration
It helps with focus and engagement. It also helps you learn when to ask for help, or to put it away for later. There is also the working together programmers do, so problems are solved within the group.
3. Learning from fellow students
Along with different approaches to problems, pair programming can expose other programmers to different thinking. This also means different skill sets can be paired in union, strengthening eachother.
4. Social skills
This helps with communication. Maybe people think different, or have different processes, and its important to utilize skills to communicate with them. That way you learn from each other!
5. Job interview readiness
This skill is used to test how an applicant will fit into the current team dynamics. Sure, skills are important, but team work skills are some really great skills to have too! Like communication!
6. Work environment readiness
companies expect to have to train this into new developers, but we are already trained! This gives us an advantage in the job search.

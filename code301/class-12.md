## EJS Partials

> Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views

> Partials let you define that reusable bundle of code in a file and include it wherever you need it.

> sameness makes perfect places to use partials

> Under the views/partials/ directory create a file callednavbar.ejs which will contain only the HTML for the navigation bar at the top of the home and post pages




 
 > note:  The <%- %> tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the -). This is important when using the include() statement since you don’t want EJS to escape your HTML characters like ‘<’, ‘>’, etc…

> the Apple personal computer that was released at the time was marketed specifically to boys (included them teasing girls’ computer skills), as were a whole range of other consoles. This gave rise to male computing culture. As a result, a 1985 study reported that 73% of men used a computer on a weekly basis, compared to 45% of women surveyed.

> By the time students now reach university, 20% of men plan to take on a career in engineering or computing. Among women, that number is just 5.8%.
